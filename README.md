## About Me

Before transitioning into web and software development, I diligently worked as a paralegal in the New England and Tri-State areas.

While in the legal industry I found myself enjoying the technical and computer driven aspects of the office which lead me to follow my true passion for front-end and back-end development.

My legal and management positions bring a fresh prospective to techincal and leaderships roles as it showcases my detailed oriented and organizational skills in any job I perform.
